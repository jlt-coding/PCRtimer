#
# both functions get a list of six integers: initial melt, final extension, melting time, annealtime, extendtime, cycles
# mcalc also gets the length of the product
# kfidelity also gets a scaling factor 'dial' from 0 to 99 which represents the desired fidelity,
# where 75 should leave the factory settings unchanged, 0 is an overly quick PCR and 99 an overly thorough PCR.
# both functions should return another list of 6 integers, representing the updated PCR parameters
